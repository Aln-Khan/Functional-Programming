To-Do List - React

FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) principles are not explicitly employed in this React component (App) I've shared. Instead, this code primarily demonstrates the use of React hooks (useState and useEffect) for managing state and side effects within a functional React component.

Here are some highlights of how React hooks are used in this code:

State Management (useState):

useState is used to manage different pieces of local state within the component (isTaskCompleted, allTodos, newTitle, newDescription, completedTodos).
Each state variable (useState) maintains its own independent state.
Side Effects (useEffect):

useEffect is used to perform side effects in function components. In this case, it's used for loading data from localStorage when the component mounts ([] as the dependency array ensures it runs only once after the initial render).
The effect reads from localStorage to initialize allTodos and completedTodos states.
Event Handling:

Event handlers (handleAddTodo, handleDeleteTodo, handleCompletedTodo, handleDeleteCompletedTodo) are defined to manage various actions like adding a new todo, deleting todos, marking todos as completed, and deleting completed todos.
These event handlers interact with state (useState setters) and manage the data accordingly (e.g., updating state, persisting data to localStorage).
Conditional Rendering:

The component uses conditional rendering based on the value of isTaskCompleted. This determines whether to display the list of active todos (isTaskCompleted === false) or completed todos (isTaskCompleted === true).
State Updates:

State updates (setAllTodos, setCompletedTodos, etc.) are performed using immutable patterns (e.g., spreading arrays) to ensure React's state updates trigger re-renders properly.
Components & Props:

The component uses various UI elements (input, button, h3, p, icons from react-icons) to render the todo list and manage interactions.
In summary, this React component demonstrates modern React practices using functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and side effects. It handles basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing a todo list application, along with persisting data to localStorage for state persistence across page reloads. While it doesn't directly apply FRP concepts, it leverages React's declarative and functional approach to building UI components.
